Multi-Country E-Commerce Analytics Project

An advanced SQL + Python data analysis project simulating an international e-commerce business across multiple countries. This project covers customer segmentation, product performance, churn analysis, and strategic insights using a fully relational database.

ðŸ“Š Project Features

Technologies Used
- Google Colab (for interactive notebook)
- SQLite (embedded relational database)
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (data visualization)

 Project Structure
- Database Setup: Simulated data for customers, products, and orders.
- SQL Queries: Advanced use of joins, aggregations, views, and CASE statements.
- Customer Segmentation: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring and labeling.
- Churn Detection: Identifies inactive customers using recency thresholds.
- Visual Insights: Interactive dashboards with graphs on customer segments, top products, and country-wise sales.
- Reusable Views: SQL views for reporting, dashboards, and downstream use.
